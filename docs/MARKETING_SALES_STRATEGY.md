🎯 A11y Audit Pro - WCAG Accessibility for Figma

Make your Figma designs accessible to everyone - without breaking the bank.

👋 Hey Product Hunt! I'm [Name], and I built A11y Audit Pro after struggling with expensive accessibility tools that my startup couldn't afford.

🔍 What it does:
• Checks WCAG 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 compliance
• Switches between versions (only plugin that does this!)
• One-click fixes for common issues
• 25% cheaper than Stark ($9/month vs $12/month)

**LinkedIn Post:**
```
🎉 Today, I'm thrilled to announce the launch of A11y Audit Pro - a comprehensive WCAG accessibility checker for Figma.

As a designer who's passionate about inclusive design, I was frustrated by the lack of affordable, feature-rich accessibility tools. Stark is great, but at $12/month, it's out of reach for many designers - especially those at startups or freelancing.

So I built A11y Audit Pro with three goals:

1️⃣ Make it affordable ($9/month - 25% cheaper than Stark)
2️⃣ Make it comprehensive (WCAG 2.0/2.1/2.2 with version switching)
3️⃣ Make it educational (plain-English suggestions, not technical jargon)

The response from our beta users has been incredible. One designer said: "I can finally offer accessible designs to my clients without breaking the bank."

If you care about inclusive design (and I know you do!), I'd love for you to try it:
